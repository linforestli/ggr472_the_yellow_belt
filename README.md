# Re-imagine Toronto’s Yellowbelt

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide a web map of Toronto’s building footprint and Zoning By-Law, especially the building height restriction inside the yellowbelt, to raise public awareness of the imbalance in the housing market to city officials and planners, new-comers to the City, and residents seeking affordable housing. By uncover the building height, zoning, and density pattern in the City, we will explore this paradox of housing supply through data visualization and interaction.
